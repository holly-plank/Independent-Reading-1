<!--Hello, Scholar! This document is a tool to help you work through/connect the ideas you have been generating during our Independent Readings. What is that through line that you have established...that weaves its way through these works? 

To help you organize your thinking, I have established a template that you can follow based on the exploratory method used in composition studies. This is an old method that finds its origins in Montaigne's Essais. 

Through this process you will also learn a little bit about computer literacy and computer science. Enough to allow you to build web texts and understand file management. 
  
<!--To get started, you will need to fork my repository from GitHub if you haven't already. If you want to easily publish it on GitHub, I'll give you more information at the end of this document. But for right now, fork, and then download the website to a zip file (or clone it, if you know what that means). Go ahead and put these files in a secure place (folder) where you will be able to find them and organize your other assets like images, pdfs, etcetera. You will also need a text editor like "brackets.io" or "atom.io" or "notepad-plus-plus.org." Open the style.css and index.html documents in the text editor and we can get started building our web text.--> 

<!--BTW. You can leave these hidden HTML text fields be, or delete them. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--First we will need to do some work in the head of the document. The head organizes important information needed to explain to browsers how the website will work. Go ahead and change the title of this HTML document below, from "Hello, Scholar!" to whatever you want it to be called. Your new text will appear in your browser tab-->
    
<title>Hello, Scholar!</title>

<!-- We'll need to do some more work in this section, but to do so, we'll need to make some changes on your style.css file. Developers refer to this division as a "Hero Block."  

Place a .jpg or .png in the same file folder as this project (hint: simplify the name). Then you'll need to change the background image name on the style.css page to match you image asset.

Change the other relevant information in this section-->

Looking to add even more components? You have come to the right place. Copy and paste the code into your body.

***Add an image. 
To add an image, all you need to do is add the HTML, the CSS style has already been set. Just drop the following code between other <div></div> elements...and you will need to replace the stinky feet.jpg. 

***Small image: 

<div>
<img src="feet.jpg" alt="Paris" class="center-small-image" alt="my feet in water" style="width:50%;height:50%;">
</div>

***Large image:   

<div>
<img src="feet.jpg" alt="Paris" class="center-large-image" alt="my feet in water" style="width:100%;height:100%;">
</div>

***Add a photo grid:

<div class="row"> 
  <div class="column">
    <img src="pgrid1.jpg" alt="describe the image HERE for accessibility purposes">
    <img src="pgrid2.jpg" alt="describe the image HERE for accessibility purposes">
  </div>
  <div class="column">
    <img src="pgrid3.jpg" alt="describe the image HERE for accessibility purposes">

Looking to publish this in GitHub? Here is what you need to do.

Go back to your forked repository in GitHub or create a new repository. Click upload, and select/drag and drop all of your files... all of them, index.html. style.html, readme, and your image assets. Click commit. This will replace/add all essential files to make your Pitt Fuego. Great, now your Pitt Fuego files are where they need to be. Now go to your repository "settings." Scroll down to "GitHub Pages." Here you will change "source" from "none" to "master branch." This will publish your Pitt Fuego online. If you scroll back down on this page, you will find a URL is now available in this section. Copy and Paste. And now it's time to spread the fire!
